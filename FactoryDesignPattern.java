public class FactoryDesignPattern {

    /**
     *
     * 	1.	Encapsulation of Creation Logic: The Factory Pattern centralizes the creation logic, allowing easy changes
     * 	in how objects are instantiated without modifying the client code.
     * <p>
     * 	2.	Decoupling Client Code: By using getShape, the client doesnâ€™t need to know about specific subclasses (e.g.,
     * 	Circle, Square), reducing dependencies and improving flexibility.
     * <p>
     * 	3.	Easier Maintenance and Scalability: Adding new shapes only requires changes in the factory, not in multiple
     * 	parts of your code.
     * <p>
     * 	4.	Enables Polymorphism: The factory can return different subclasses based on input, letting you change the
     * 	object returned without altering the client code.
